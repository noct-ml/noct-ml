# James Jones – AI Projects👋 Welcome! I’m James — a self-taught technologist with 20+ years across IT, cybersecurity, reverse engineering, and now focused on **machine learning and AI systems**.  This repo is a home for my projects where I explore AI safety, adversarial analysis, and creative applications of LLMs and related tools.  ---## 🔬 Featured Projects### 🌀 Noesis*Forensic tracing of AI models.*  - Tools for capturing and analyzing activation traces in UNet/VAE/transformer models.  - Concepts like **soulprints** (activation fingerprints) and delta snapshots to compare prompts and behaviors.  - Future direction: scaling from toy experiments to applied forensic AI auditing.  [Noesis Repo →](./Noesis)---### 👻 EVP Simulator*AI meets ghost radio.*  - Python audio tool inspired by the Panasonic RR-DR60 EVP recorder.  - Adds ghostly overlays, entropy-based artifacts, and timestamped logging.  - Mix of sound design + algorithmic weirdness.  [EVP Simulator Repo →](./EVP-Simulator)---### 🌍 FAISS Geolocation Index*Vector search on massive datasets.*  - Filters and vectorizes images from the YFCC100M dataset.  - Builds a FAISS index for geolocation experiments.  - CSV-based workflow, scalable for research or creative use.  [FAISS Repo →](./FAISS-Geolocation)---### 🛠️ Reverse Engineering Utilities*Old school meets AI era.*  - Scripts and tools for monitoring DLL traffic (e.g., `ztdnsapi.dll`).  - Fake service emulation for testing system hooks.  - Shows my background in security research and low-level systems.  [RE Utils Repo →](./Reverse-Engineering-Utils)---## ⚡ About Me- Reverse engineering + cybersecurity roots.  - Linux ecosystem native (Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, KVM/QEMU).  - Building bridges between **AI curiosity** and **security mindset**.  - Always exploring the absurd, the Nightside, and the cutting edge.  ---🖤 *This account is my ongoing experiment log. Check back for updates as I keep building, breaking, and exploring.*
