# James Jones – AI Projects

👋 Welcome! I’m James — a self-taught technologist with 20+ years across IT, cybersecurity, reverse engineering, and now focused on **machine learning and AI systems**.  

This repo is a home for my projects where I explore AI safety, adversarial analysis, and creative applications of LLMs and related tools.
