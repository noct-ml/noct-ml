😺 James Jones – AI Projects

👋 Welcome! I’m James — a self-taught technologist with 20+ years across IT, cybersecurity, reverse engineering, and now focused on **machine learning and AI systems**.  

This repo is a home for my projects where I explore AI safety, adversarial analysis, and creative applications of LLMs and related tools.

## 🔬 Featured Projects

### 🌀 Noesis
*Forensic tracing of AI models.*  
- Tools for capturing and analyzing activation traces in UNet/VAE/transformer models.  
- Concepts like **soulprints** (activation fingerprints) and delta snapshots to compare prompts and behaviors.

### 🌀 EchoForge
*ChatGPT Conversation Alchemist*  
- Conversations with ChatGPT are living records — but in Workspace accounts, export vanished into the void.
- EchoForge restores that freedom: it takes your “Save Page As...” ChatGPT .html files and transmutes them into clean, human-readable Markdown (or JSONL) with speaker labels, code blocks, and full emoji + symbol preservation.
- Built for creators, researchers, and digital archivists who believe their words deserve to endure.
