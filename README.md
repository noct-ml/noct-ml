## ⚙️ About Me  

- 🧠 Former IC Ops Support analyst turned self-taught AI craftsman.

## 🜂 Philosophy  

> *“Sanity is not a luxury; it’s the law of those who refuse to shatter.”*  
>  
> My work lives where systems meet souls — where logic and myth share a wall.  
> Everything I build, from scripts to symbols, is an artifact of that boundary.
